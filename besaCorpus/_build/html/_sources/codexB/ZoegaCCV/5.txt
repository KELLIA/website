	For if man remembers the Lord and Jerusalem of heaven comes into his mind, no unclean thought nor any wickedness shall prevail over him, because he has built his house upon the rock [5] which is Christ the hope o f every man who sets his hope upon him, as it is written, ‘I have put my trust in ip you, Lord, let me never be ashamed. Deliver me and save me in your righteousness. Incline {*p. 12} your ear to me and hasten to save me. Be to me a God of strength and a house of refuge to save me, for you are my defence and my refuge. For your name’s sake, you will lead me and nurture me. You will bring me out of this snare which is they have hidden for me, for you are my protector. I will commend my spirit into your hands, you have redeemed me, Lord God of truth.

	You have hated those who cherish vanities to no purpose, but I have trusted in the Lord. I will rejoice and be glad in your mercy, for you have regarded my humility and you have saved my soul from my afflictions. You have not given me into the hand of the enemy. You have set my feet in a spacious place [7]. For the angel of the Lord surrounds those who fear him and delivers them [8].

	 So therefore, brethren, it is good for us to cleave to God and to put our hope on the Lord Christ, the Saviour of everyone who sincerely cries to him and who puts his trust in his mercy, that we may have help on the day of our tribulation and find mercy before him in the time of our affliction, which is the day of each one’s visitation.

	For as it has been said, ‘Possessions shall not profit on the day of. wrath’ [9], so also no wickedness, nor hatred, ao nor pride, nor quarrellers, murmurers, slanderers, whisperers, and no sinners of any kind who provoke God to anger, shall profit on the day of wrath, which is the day when the soul of each one shall be plucked out miserably, with no one to wipe the tears from our eyes [10] and no one to hear us. when we cry out.

	In like manner did the rich man, demented and groaning, ask for a drop's of water in the burning of the fire which is in hell, and it was not given to him, but other reproaches {* p. 13} and sorrows were told to him, as it is written in the gospel [13].

	Let us therefore, brethren, strive, and let us depart from our wickednesses,’our disobediences, our stiff-neckedness, our boastings, and turn and repent while there is time, before the day of our end comes upon us suddenly like a snare [14], and all these sufferings befall us, with no one to deliver us and no one to help us.
