	Thus it is with us : if we obey the words of our father and his teachings which he commanded us, the Lord will deliver us from every evil thing [4]_ , as it has been said, 'My son, if you receive the words of my commandments and hide them with you, your ear will hear wisdom and you will pay heed to understanding [5]_ .
