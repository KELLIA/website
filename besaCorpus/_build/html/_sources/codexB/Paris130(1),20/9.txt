	from every evil1. Let ns obey him who urges us and s encourages us towards the teaching which says, ‘My son, if you receive the words of my commandment and hide them with you, your ear will hear wisdom and you will pay heed to understanding and give it to your son as teaching’ 2.

.. note:: And again, ‘My son, do not be lax, keep my counsel and my opinion that your soul may live and that grace may be about your neck. Then there shall be healing for your flesh and care for your bones, that you may walk confidently in peace on all your ways and that your foot may not stumble’3.

.. note::  And again, ‘Keep my commandments and do not forget them, and do not forget the word of my mouth. Do not forsake it and it shall receive you unto itself; love it and it shall guard you4. Turn it to yourself and it shall exalt you; honour it in order that it may receive you unto itself, that it may put a crown of grace upon your head and protect you with a crown of delight’5,

.. note:: Therefore, do not let us be negligent, lest we repent at our end and say sorrowfully, ‘Why did I not want them to teach me, and my heart turn away from reproofs?’ 6 or say, * ‘I did not listen to the voice of him who teaches me, and did not incline my ear to him who instructs me*7.
