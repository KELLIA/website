	(p.4) [wo]rld, when we were walking in defilements, and drunkennesses, and revellings, and carousals, and abominable idolatries [1]_ , walking in wickedness and envy, hateful and hating one another [2]_ , disobedient, erring [3]_ , walking in the vanity of our hearts, darkened in our thoughts, alinated from the life of God because of the ignorance which was in us and because of our obstinacy, having given ourselves up to defilement and the performance of every uncleanness.

	Now we were not taught in this manner [4]_ but rather thus were we taught, 'Work out your salvation in fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you the will and the fulfilment of the will' [5]_ .

	Moreover Moses, at that time, having seen how the children of Israel hastened to forget the commandments of God, commanded them to make fringes on the borders of their garments that they might see them and remember and not forget the commandments of God [6]_ . but as for us, let us put the fear of God into our hearts instead of fringes that we may not forget the commandments which our fatehrs have given us.

	Therefore, brethren, let us turn and repent before the opportunity has gone from us, and while the light is with us, which is the teachings of our fathers. As the Lord has said, 'Walk as long as you have the light, that the darkness may not overtake you' [7]_ . And, 'As being in the day, let us walk decently' [8]_ . And, 'For those who sleep sleep in the night, and those who are drunk are drunk in the night. But we are of the day. Let us be sober, having put upon us the breastplate of fa[ith] [9]_
