	[why do you] subject [yourselves] to ordinances in the world as those who are alive, touch not, nor taste, nor go near?' This means that we have departed from the sins of the world by having renounced them. Why do we again turn to be implicated in them?

	On this it has also been said, 'For you at that time were darkness but now are light in the Lord: walk as children of the light - for the fruit of the light is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth - examining what is pleasing to the Lord, and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.

	Therefore, let us expose our follies in us and all the thoughts of the devil which he plants in us, and the disbeliefs, and hatreds, inasmuch as we are made to think evil against one another while we are not for one another at all.

	So therefore, be watchful that we may embrace the good, for there are many who are with one another in the body but far from one another in heart and love. Furthermore there are many who, though not with one another in the body, are with one another always in the love of Christ, and the love of the Spirit, and the good-pleasure of Jesus.

For those who have imperishable wealth in Christ ought to watch over it.

	If those who have property, gold and silver and possessions, watch lest robbers steal it; then how much more fitting is it for us to watch lest the enemy steal the good which we do - our prayers, and our fastings, and our purity, and our constancy.

::

	For the theft of silver and gold is not on the same level. But in proportion as virginity and the monastic way of life are precious, so is the enemy eager to steal them. He who has acquired for himself pearls or gold keeps vigil. If the enemy keeps vigil for the sake of wickedness, then how much more shall he who has property watch lest it be plotted for.

	Let us remember what our father has said, 'Brethren of our way of life fast and pray too; they keep vigil, but they also lie, fight, quarrel, murmur, and speak evil. They hate, walk in disaffection, defile themselves, and are deceitful; they commit every evil deed. Such men labour in vain and no advantage at all shall accrue to them. Moreover their constancy is in vain'.

	For robbers do not break into a house or place where there is no property, but they break into the place whre property is to be found; and they do not break into the place which is guarded against despoiling, but the place where they know they do not guard and are asleep, into such do they break and carry off whatever they find.

	Thus also, the devil does not rob him who is watchful and guards his suffering but him whom he shall find off his guard, who neither fears God nor remembers how he is to come into the hands of God.

	Therefore, brethren, everyone who is of one mind with God and with our fathers and with us also, whether man or woman, whether great or small, with us and with you, take courage and be vigilant.
