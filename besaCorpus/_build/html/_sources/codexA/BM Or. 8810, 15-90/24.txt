	It is right for you and good for your soul, wretched ones, to learn whence you are, and give glory to the Lord your God before the darkness comes and your feet stumble upon the dark mountains. You will look for light, a shadow of death is there; and they shall be put in darkness.

	How long then will we draw down upon us r.he word which is written, 'The ungodly passed over the landmark’[4], because you steal, you lie, you are disobedient, you work iniquity, you act lawlessly, you violate the commandments of Christ, von destroy your body, you sin in everything, as it was said, ' The way of the daughter of my people is not towards upright­ ness nor towards purity’[5], and again, ‘This is your wickedness, for it is bitter, because it reached to your heart’[6].

	Moreover it was said, in censuring the untaught and foolish ones amongst us who have not learned wisdom but walked in darkness, ‘Is there no balm in Gilead or is there no physician there? Why did the healing of the daughter of my people not come up?’[7] which means, is there no scripture among us or have we not been taught in the law of the Lord namely, ‘Cease from your wickednesses, learn to do good'?[8]

	Yet we were not afraid and did not realise that we should depart from our inciting of God to wrath by our evil deeds, but we chose to bring upon us the word which is written, ‘Because of your hardness and your impenitent heart, you treasure up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and the revelation of the just judgement of God, who will render to every man according to his works’[9].

	Woe to us for we have sinned! That is why our heart was grieved 12. {*p. 69} Our ignorance is will teach us and our wickedness will upbraid us. Enow therefore and understand that it is bitter for us to forsake the commandments of God 13 and the laws of our fathers.

	Indeed every theft is evil and cursed in the sight of our Lord Jesus, but this is still more evil in the sight of God and men. And it is more evil than any transgression and shamelessness. It even leads on to murder,

	And even as it was said, ‘Cursed be he who shall remove his neighbour’s landmarks and all the people shall say, “It shall be so” ’ [26], so shall he come to be cursed who has stolen or shall steal from the shares of his neighbours, whether their necessities, or their money, or their clothing, or their cloak, or anything which is theirs, for none lack anything that they need, but they sin against themselves and draw the curse of God upon themselves.

	As it was said of Babylon at that time, ‘We healed her but she was not healed; let us abandon her and go, because her judgement reached up to heaven, it mounted aloft to the stars’ [37], so shall the angels of God and those who teach you forsake you, saying, ‘We taught them ,but they were not taught; let us depart from them, because their, judgement reached unto God and his Christ, who will judge each one according to his works’ [38].

	hus also unless a man mortifies his body, he shall be without avail in his works, but if he mortify it he shall bear much fruit in good works, .as it is written, ‘He who died in the flesh ceased from sin so as to be no longer in the lusts of men, but ratber spend the rest of the days of his life according to the will of God’ [40].
